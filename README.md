Term project for Foundations of Computer Network course.
Implemented node joining, node leaving(a few edge cases were not handled) and message routing associated with it from the paper - "A scalable content-addressable network", et al, Sylvia Ratnasamy , Paul Francis , Mark Handley , Richard Karp , Scott Shenker, A scalable content-addressable network, Proceedings of the 2001 conference on Applications, technologies, architectures, and protocols for computer communications, p.161-172, August 2001". Tested the system on a cluster of 10 nodes.
